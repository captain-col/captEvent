/// The base class for ND280 data with access provided using the Use() and
/// Get() methods.  In some ways this is analogous to the root TObject class,
/// except that this is specialize for saving event to a file.  A TDatum
/// represents a single piece of information.  This is supplemented by the
/// TDataVector (which is derived from TData) which is used to represent
/// hierarchies of data and is similar in concept to a TFolder or a
/// TDirectory.  The main difference between TObject (TFolder) and TDatum
/// (TDataVector) is that a TDatum object maintains information about the
/// object which owns it "this".  As a result, data hierarchies built using
/// TDatum objects do not need to use global variables for navigation so
/// multiple hierarchies can be trivially handled.
///
/// A TDatum event is the base class (similar to TObject) of several classes
/// for saving data.  It can be used as a direct parent for any class saving
/// "scalar" data, or which does not have any child "TDatum" classes.  The
/// TDataVector class is derived from TDatum and is intended to help save
/// hierarchies of data.  Objects that are derived from the TDatum object can
/// be used to constructed a "virtual file system" of information.  This
/// allows arbitrary information to be saved with an event.
///
/// When working with TDataVector and TDatum derived objects, you can think of
/// the structure as a file system with directories and files.  The TDatum
/// objects are the files.  The TDataVector objects are the directories, but
/// notice that TDataVector derives from TDatum, so "directories" are also
/// "files".  You can access "files" (i.e. any TDatum derived objects) below a
/// current object using the Use(), or Get() methods.  You can check for the
/// existence of a "file" using the Has() method.
