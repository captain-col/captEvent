/// This is an abstract base class used to save G4Hit objects into a root
/// output file.  It contains the information that all hits from the
/// simulation should save into the output file, and allows the rest of the
/// code to handle hits in a polymorphic way.  It must be inherited by an
/// specific instance class to actually save MC information.  The ND280MC
/// expects the electronics response to be simulated off-line, and to assign
/// the sensor identifiers to each hit.
///
/// In the ND280MC, this class is multiply inherited with G4VHit to create a
/// class that can be used in a G4HitCollection.  The behavior is designed so
/// that the TG4VHit inherited classes in oaEvent contain all of the payload
/// for the hit, and class in ND280mc contains all of the interface related to
/// the G4 infrastructure.
