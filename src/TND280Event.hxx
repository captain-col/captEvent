/// The event container (get the current event using
/// TEventFolder::GetCurrentEvent()).
///
/// Provide the highest level event container for ND280 off-axis events.  This
/// is a TDataVector and provides an effective "root directory" for all of the
/// information saved with an event.  This also contains the infrastructure to
/// interface with TEventFolder class that couples events to the ROOT browser
/// and will appear as a root folder in //root/Events/ named by the event
/// number.  For example, an event that is read will appear as a folder,
/// "//root/Events/event.0.00023.00001324".
///
/// The TND280Event class provides the following event structure.
///
/// - event/
///   - raw/    Raw MIDAS data (if it is available).  This directory won't
///             exist if the raw data is not available for this event. 
///   - digits/ Raw data for the sensor hits.  This is a copy of the data 
///             available from the MIDAS DAQ data files.
///   - hits/   Data about the sensor hits.  This contains calibrated hit
///             data. 
///   - truth/  Exists only for MC events.  This is all of the information 
///             saved from the MC.   
///   - fits/   Results from fitters.  This is a data vector full of results 
///             saved from any fitter run on this event.
///
/// TND280Event objects are usually read from an input file using a
/// TND280Input object (output is with a TND280Output).  The last event read
/// will be available from TEventFolder::GetCurrentEvent() which is a static
/// method.  Interactive programs which want to provide a method to keep
/// multiple events in memory (e.g. the event display), should get the current
/// event using the TEventFolder::GetCurrentEvent() method.  Events can then
/// be saved automatically into a root folder by calling the
/// TEventFolder::GetEventFolder() static method.
///
/// The event Header information can be accessed using the GetHeader() method.
/// For instance, to get the MCM time from an event, a program would use the
/// following snippet.
///
/// \code
/// unsigned int mcmTime = event.GetHeader().GetMCMSecond();
/// \endcode
///
/// The trigger type of an event can be conveniently checked using
/// CheckTrigger() which is used:
///
/// \code
/// if (event.CheckTrigger(ND::Trigger::kBeamSpill)) {
///     This is a beam spill...
/// }
