/// Contain a calibrated wave form (collection of time ordered hits) for a
/// single calibrated hit detector element (the entire wave form must come
/// from the same channel).  This corresponds to a real measurement inside the
/// detector, but after it has been fully calibrated.  The TMultiHit class is
/// designed to allow waveforms to be easily split into separate zero
/// suppressed TMultiHit objects.  A new TMultiHit can be created from a
/// sequence of THandle<TSingleHit> objects between a "first" and "last"
/// iterator
///
/// \code
/// std::vector< THandle<TSingleHit> > sVect;  -- must be filled!
/// THandle<TMultiHit> mHit(new TMultiHit(sVect.begin(),sVect.end()));
/// THandle<TMultiHit> aHit(new TMultiHit(mHit.begin(),mHit.end()));
/// \endcode
///
/// The access to individual measurements in a TMultiHit object is done
/// through an interface similar to a std:vector< THandle<TSingleHit> >.  The
/// measurements can be accessed using iterators (the TMulitHit::begin() and
/// TMultiHit::end() methods), or by indexing (the TMultiHit::operator[] and
/// TMultiHit::size() methods).  As with all (non-TComboHit) hit objects, a
/// TMultiHit object is immutable after it has been created.
///
/// Since TMultiHit inherits from THit, the standard time, charge, position,
/// &c information are provided.  However, this summary information is only
/// based on a crude summary of the wave form (e.g. time of the first hit,
/// total sum of the charge, &c).

    /// scintillator bar, or the TPC micromega pad).  Notice that it is

    /// instance, if a scintillator has double ended readout, it will have two
    /// associated channels that will both generate a hit for the same volume.

    /// For most users, the geometry identifiers replace the functionality of
    /// the TGeoManager node identifiers.  The most common usage of the node
    /// identifier is to set the current node using TGeoManager::CdNode().
    /// The same operation can be done with a TGeometryId using
    /// TGeomIdManager::CdId(TGeometryId).  The CdId method makes the volume
    /// identified by the TGeometryId into the current TGeoManager volume, and
    /// then the user can use the various TGeoManager methods to query
    /// information.  For instance, the node identifier associated with a
