///   Stefan Ritt, Pierre-Andre Amaudruz and Konstantin Olchanski 
///
/// in the rootana package which is part of the Midas Data
/// Acquisition:-
/// 
///     https://midas.psi.ch/
/// 
/// The code was extracted from revision 55 of Subversion repository:-
///
///      svn://ladd00.triumf.ca/rootana/trunk rootana

/// The T2K group should monitor changes to that code looking for enhancements

/// TMidasFile is a class that can sequentially read a MIDAS .mid file using C
/// I/O and return a TND280RawEvent using the method:-
/// 
///   ND::TND280RawEvent* TMidasFile::ReadRawEvent() 
/// 
/// The current implementation first fills a TMidasEventParser, which is
/// another class derived from rootana, using the
/// 
///   bool Read(TMidasEventParser *event);
/// 
/// method and then uses the TND280RawEvent(TMidasEventParser&) constructor.
