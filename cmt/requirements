package captEvent
# This package provides the core I/O and support functions for all of the
# ND280 software and must be kept stable.  As much as possible, backward
# compatibility must be maintained.  Please contact the package manager
# before making changes.  In particular, contact the package manager
# before designing (or especially implementing) any structural changes so
# we can make sure that all of the impacts of the change are understood by
# the entire group.  A new stable version should be created before
# significant changes are made.  Email enquiries should be directed to
# t2k-nd280-software@nngroup.physics.sunysb.edu
#
# Changes in captEvent affect the output format of events.  Incompatible
# changes can make older data unreadable.
