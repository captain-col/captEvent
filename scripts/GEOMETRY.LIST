# GEOMETRY CONTEXT MAP:
#
# This file is maintained in the oaEvent/script directory.  Changes should
# be committed there, and then copied by an oaEvent package manager using:
#
#   scp GEOMETRY.LIST nd280data@repo.nd280.org:nd280files/geometry/
#
# This specifies which geometry file should be used as a function of the
# event context.  All dates and times are in JST, and the order doesn't
# matter.  The earliest date will be used as the default geometry.
# Geometries as specified by their hash value.
#
# All text after a "#" is treated as a comment.  
#
# Each line containing a date must be formated as follows:
#
# Year/Month/Day hour:minute hash
#
# Year   -- Must be the full year (e.g. 2010)
# Month  -- Must be the month number (1 to 12)
# Day    -- Must be the day of the month (1 to 31)
#     The year, month and day must be seperated by "/", and there must
#     not be spaces.
#
# hour   -- The hour of the day (0 to 23)
# minute -- The minute of the hour (0 to 59)
#     The hour and minute must be separated by ":", and there must not
#     be spaces. 
# 
# The hash code contains five eight digit hex numbers separated by
# dashs.  At the moment, only the first eight digit hex value is significant.


# Specify a default geometry to be used when the context is not in the
# file.  This has the full detector, and water in the P0D.  It should be
# updated as the MC geometry becomes more detailed.

# The initial commissioning stage with the magnet in the open position.
# Rather than try to simulate all the different configurations during this
# period this is the baseline (full detector geometry) with the magnet
# open.

# This is the baseline geometry for the magnet closed period.  During this
# period, the P0D is empty and only the top left barrel ECal is installed.

# During this period, the P0D is full and only the top left barrel ECal is
#  installed.

# $Log: GEOMETRY.LIST,v $
# Revision 1.10  2013/02/06 18:58:16  mcgrew
# Add a new entry for the drained p0d starting as of 2013.02.06.
#
# Revision 1.9  2013/01/11 02:04:46  mcgrew
# Add entry for when the P0D was filled before Run 4.
#
# Revision 1.8  2011/12/08 20:39:36  mcgrew
# Update the geometry list with the new ND280MC v5r1p3 geometries.  This
# geometry has much improved mass models, and detectors have been shifted to
# fix problems in the design locations.
#
# Revision 1.7  2011/02/16 15:22:51  mcgrew
# Update the geometries to include the improved geometry from ND280MC v4r41.
#
# Include a geometry for the new run period with the P0D water out.
#
# Revision 1.6  2011/02/02 21:54:04  mcgrew
# Include the INTERIM ECal geometry into the geometry list.  This geometry
# will be replaced after the next ND280MC freeze.
#
# Revision 1.5  2010/11/09 20:48:31  mcgrew
# Update the 2010-02 geometries with fix to FGD dead material.  The active
# elements remain the same, but there is now more space to align the FGD.
#
# Revision 1.4  2010/10/08 16:43:46  mcgrew
# Update to nd280mc v4r37p0 geometries.  This has the P0D moved to it's
# design location.  The DsECal active region has moved 13 mm upstream.  Dead
# material has been added around the FGD.
#
# Revision 1.3  2010/05/04 20:47:30  mcgrew
# Update the list to ND280MC v4r35p3.  This adjusts the positions of the TPC,
# FGD and DsECal to their design locations.
#
# Revision 1.2  2010/02/22 21:23:39  mcgrew
# First cut at list for upcoming runs.
#
# Revision 1.1  2009/12/17 04:01:05  mcgrew
# Save a list of default geometries to be used as a function of run date.
# The list is saved in the same place as the geometry files.
